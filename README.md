# Wallpaper Generator Swift Playgrounds #

A swift playgrounds code that randomly use lines and circles creating mandalas and curves to generate a new wallpaper each time.

The project is developed to generate wallpapers for iPhoneSE, iPhoneX, iPhone6 and iPad.

I created this same system on the web, if you want to see the repository look [here](https://github.com/adrojodev/Web-Wallpaper-Generator).

If you have any doubt or contribution, email me! I'll answer the quickest I can.

Enjoy!
